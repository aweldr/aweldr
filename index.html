            <h4>Brokerage Investment Professional</h4>
            <p>
              I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor's in
              Retail Management and minors in both Business Administration and
              French.
              <br />
              Currently, I work with Vanguard to field calls from both potential and
              longtime clients, providing insight on a broad range of financial
              topics and helping them find the right mix of Vanguard investment
              products to achieve the best chances for investing success.
              <br />
              I hold an active Series 7 license, and am 50 state licensed through the
              Series 63. My CRD is

            <h4>Software Engineering</h4>
            <p>
              I enjoy building things, and I enjoy helping people. Building software
              that people can use to better their lives is a logical next step! As I
              strive towards engineering useful software, my current learning focuses
              include the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>HTML5</strong>, to create semantic and accessible page
                layouts
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>CSS</strong>, to create beautiful and practical webpage
                designs
              </li>

              <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>, to add functions as appropriate</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              When I'm not working towards my development in financial acumen or
              software engineering, you may find me watching Gamecock athletics,
              working with Special Olympics, or lifting weights.
