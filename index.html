            <p>
              I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor's in
              Retail Management and minors in both Business Administration and
              French.
              <br />
              Currently, I work at Vanguard to assist both prospective and current
              clients with finding financial success. Through consultative sales, I
              partner clients with the best possible products to set them up to meet
              their unique goals. I hold an active Series 7 license, and am 50 state
              licensed through the Series 63. My CRD is

            <h4>Software Engineering</h4>
            <p>
              I enjoy building things, and I enjoy helping people. Building software
              that people can use to better their lives is a logical next step! As I
              strive towards engineering useful software, my current learning focuses
              include the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong>, to create semantic
                and accessible page layouts
              </li>
              <li><strong>SQL</strong>, to query and manipulate databases</li>
              <li>
                <strong>GitHub</strong> and <strong>Netlify</strong>, to track
                changes and deploy continuously with ease
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>

            <h4>Interests</h4>
            <p>
              When I'm not working towards my development in financial acumen or
              software engineering, you may find me watching Gamecock athletics,
              working with Special Olympics, or lifting weights.
              <br />
              My favorite color is yellow. I prefer mustard based
              <i>"Carolina Gold"</i> barbeque. I still haven't been convinced that a
              hotdog is a sandwich.
