            <h4>Brokerage Investment Professional</h4>
            <p>
              I graduated from the University of South Carolina with a Bachelor's in
              Retail Management and minors in both Business Administration and
              French.
              <br />
              Currently, I work with Vanguard to field calls from both potential and
              longtime clients, providing insight on a broad range of financial
              topcis and helping clients find the right mix of Vanguard investment
              products to set them up for investing success.

            <h4>Software Engineering</h4>
            <p>
              I seek to grow as a software engineer on my own time. As I strive
              towards the goal of being a talented full stack developer, my current
              stack includes, to varying degrees of expertise, the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>HTML5</strong>, to create accessible front-end layouts</li>
              <li>
                <strong>CSS</strong>, to create beautiful and useful webpage designs
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>JavaScript</strong>, to add scripts to websites as necessary
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            <h4>Interests</h4>
            <p>
              When I'm not working towards my professional development in financial
              acumen or software engineering, you may find me watching South Carolina
              athletics, working with Special Olympics, or working out.
