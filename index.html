            <h4>Software Engineering</h4>
            <p>
              I enjoy building things, and having software to assist with
              repetitive workflows allows me focus on analysis. As I strive to
              engineer useful software, my current focuses include the
              following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Visual Basic for Applications</strong>, which allows me
                to automate the day-to-day, mostly in Excel and Outlook.
              </li>
              <li><strong>SQL</strong>, to query and manipulate databases</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Java</strong>, to create powerful object oriented
                programs enabling me to automate complex processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>GitHub</strong> and <strong>Netlify</strong>, to track
                changes and deploy continuously with ease
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Interests</h4>
            <p>
              When I'm not working towards my development in financial acumen or
              software engineering, you may find me watching Gamecock athletics
              or the Carolina Hurricanes; working with Special Olympics, or
              lifting weights.

              My favorite color is yellow. I prefer mustard based
              <i>"Carolina Gold"</i> barbeque. I still haven't been convinced
              that a hotdog is a sandwich.
